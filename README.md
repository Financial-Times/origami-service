Usage
-----

### Requirements

Running the Origami Service module requires [Node.js] 6.x and [npm]. You can install with:

```sh
npm install @financial-times/origami-service
```

### API Documentation

This library makes use of [promises], and provides a wrapper around [Express] â€“ familiarity is assumed in the rest of the API documentation. You'll also need to require the module with:

```js
const origamiService = require('@financial-times/origami-service');
```

### `origamiService()`

This function returns a promise which resolves with a new [Express] application. The Express application will be started automatically, and the returned promise will reject if there's an error in startup.

```js
origamiService()
	.then(app => {
		// do something with the app
	})
	.catch(error => {
		// handle the error
	});
```

The Express application will have some additional properties, added by the Origami Service module:

  - `app.origami.server`: The [HTTP Server] which was returned by `app.listen`

### Examples

You can find example implementations of Origami-compliant services in the `examples` folder of this repo:

  - **Basic:** start a bare-bones Origami service with only the default options:

    ```sh
    node examples/basic
    ```
