Usage
-----

### Requirements

Running the Origami Service module requires [Node.js] 6.x and [npm]. You can install with:

```sh
npm install @financial-times/origami-service
```

### API Documentation

This library makes use of [promises], and provides a wrapper around [Express] â€“ familiarity is assumed in the rest of the API documentation. You'll also need to require the module with:

```js
const origamiService = require('@financial-times/origami-service');
```

### `origamiService( [options] )`

This function returns a promise which resolves with a new [Express] application. The Express application will be started automatically, and the returned promise will reject if there's an error in startup.

You can configure the created service with [an options object](#options) if you need to override any defaults.

```js
origamiService({
    port: 1234
})
.then(app => {
    // do something with the app
})
.catch(error => {
    // handle the error
});
```

The Express application will have some additional properties, added by the Origami Service module:

  - `app.origami.options`: The defaulted [options](#options) passed into the `origamiService` call
  - `app.origami.server`: The [HTTP Server] which was returned by `app.listen`

The following [Express settings] will be set:

  - `json spaces`: Configured to prettify output JSON
  - `x-powered-by`: Disabled

Some middleware will also be mounted by default, in this order:

  - [Morgan]: To log requests
  - [Static]: To serve files in the application's `public` folder

### Options

The Origami Service module can be configured with a variety of options, passed in as an object to the `origamiService` function or as [environment variables]. The priority given to each type of configuration is important:

  1. **Options object:** options passed in as an `options` object will take priority over everything. E.g. this means if you hard-code the `port` configuration in your code, the `PORT` environment variable will cease to work.
  2. **Environment:** if an option isn't found in the `options` object, then for some options an environment variable will be checked. The names of these are slightly different, and will be documented below.
  3. **Defaults:** if an option isn't found in the `options` object _or_ environment, then it will use the default value as documented below.

The available options are as follows. Where two names are separated by a `/`, the first is the object key and the second is the environment variable:

  - `basePath`: The base path of the application, which paths (e.g. public files) will be relative to. Defaults to `process.cwd()`
  - `environment/NODE_ENV`: The environment to run in. This affects things like public file max ages. One of `'production'`, `'development'`, or `'test'`. Defaults to `'development'`
  - `log`: A console object used to output non-request logs. Defaults to the global `console` object
  - `name`: The human-readable name of the application, used in logging. Defaults to `'Origami Service'`
  - `port/PORT`: The port that the application should run on. Defaults to `8080`.
  - `region/REGION`: The region to use in logging and reporting for the application. Defaults to `'EU'`
  - `requestLogFormat`: The [Morgan] log format to output request logs in. If set to `null`, request logs will not be output. Defaults to `'combined'`
  - `sentryDsn/SENTRY_DSN`: The [Sentry] DSN to send errors to. If set to `null`, errors will not be sent to Sentry. Defaults to `null`. The `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable is aliased as `RAVEN_URL`
  - `start`: Whether to automatically start the application. Defaults to `true`

### `origamiService.middleware.notFound( [message] )`

Create and return a middleware for throwing `404` "Not Found" errors. The returned middleware will pass on an error which can be caught later by an error handling middleware. The error will have a `status` property set to `404` so that your error handler can differentiate it from other errors.

This middleware should be mounted after all of your application routes:

```js
// routes go here
app.use(origamiService.middleware.notFound());
// error handler goes here
```

By default, the error message will be set to `'Not Found'`. If you wish to specify a custom message you can specify one as a parameter:

```js
app.use(origamiService.middleware.notFound('This page does not exist'));
```

### `origamiService.middleware.errorHandler()`

Create and return a middleware for rendering errors that occur in the application routes. The returned middleware logs errors to [Sentry] (if the `sentryDsn` option is present) and then renders an error page. It uses the `status` property of an error to decide on which error type to render.

This middleware should be mounted after all of your application routes, and is useful in conjuction with `origamiService.middleware.notFound`:

```js
// routes go here
app.use(origamiService.middleware.notFound());
app.use(origamiService.middleware.errorHandler());
```

### Examples

You can find example implementations of Origami-compliant services in the `examples` folder of this repo:

  - **Basic:** start a bare-bones Origami service with only the default options:

    ```sh
    node examples/basic
    ```

  - **Options:** start an Origami service with some overridden [options](#options):

    ```sh
    node examples/options
    ```

  - **Middleware:** start an Origami service using some of the built-in middleware:

    ```sh
    node examples/middleware
    ```
